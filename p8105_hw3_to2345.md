## Problem 3

Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data. Your final dataset should
include all originally observed variables and values; have useful
variable names; include a weekday vs weekend variable; and encode data
with reasonable variable classes. Describe the resulting dataset
(e.g. what variables exist, how many observations, etc).

``` r
library(tidyverse)

accel_data = 
  read_csv("../data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>%
    mutate(
      day = factor(day, levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday"))
    ) %>% 
    mutate(
      weekend_indicator = case_when(
        day != "Saturday" & day != "Sunday" ~ "0",
        day == "Saturday" | day == "Sunday" ~ "1",
        TRUE ~ ""
      )
    ) 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

``` r
accel_data_long = 
        accel_data %>% 
        pivot_longer(
        activity_1:activity_1440,
        names_to = "minute",
        names_prefix = "activity_",
        values_to = "activity"
    ) 

summarise_all(accel_data_long, typeof)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 6
    ##   week   day_id day     weekend_indicator minute    activity
    ##   <chr>  <chr>  <chr>   <chr>             <chr>     <chr>   
    ## 1 double double integer character         character double

``` r
accel_data_long = 
  accel_data_long %>% 
  mutate(
    week = as.integer(week),
    day_id = as.integer(day_id),
    day = as.character(day),
    minute = as.integer(minute),
    activity = as.numeric(activity),
    weekend_indicator = as.integer(weekend_indicator)
  )
```

  - The resulting dataset has variables including: activity, day,
    day\_id, minute, week, weekend\_indicator with the variable class of
    integer, integer, character, integer, integer, double respectively.
  - The resulting dataset has 50400 observations in total.

Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity
over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate accross minutes to
create a total activity variable for each day, and create a table
showing these totals. Are any trends apparent?

``` r
accel_data_long %>% 
  group_by(day_id) %>% 
  mutate(total_activity = sum(activity)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = day_id, y = total_activity)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_line()
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_to2345_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="90%" />

``` r
accel_data_long %>% 
  group_by(day_id) %>% 
  mutate(total_activity = sum(activity)) %>%
  select(week, day_id, day, weekend_indicator, total_activity) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 1)
```

**From the graph and the table showing the change on the total activity
overdays we can barely see apparent trend. One trend that is captured is
that the fluctuation of the total activity is getting larger with the
increase of days. What’s more, there seems like a trend of decreasing
average activity with the increase of days from the graph.**

Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of the
day. Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the week. Describe
in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph

``` r
accel_data_long %>%
  group_by(day, minute) %>% 
  mutate(
    average_activity_minute = mean(activity)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = minute, y = average_activity_minute, color = day)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .05)+
  geom_smooth()+
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
    viridis::scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE)
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

<img src="p8105_hw3_to2345_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="90%" />

  - Based on the graoh produced, there are several patterns that is
    observed:
  - There are difference in the time of the activity peak accross
    difference days, the most obvious difference detected is the peak of
    activity in Sunday and that in Friday.
  - Commonly, there is a trend of increasing activity until the 1250 min
    of that day, which is followed by a rapid decrease in activity
  - It looks like Saturday has the lowest activity level on average.
